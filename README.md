#  ♒ Hospital Network Design & Implementation Using Cisco Packet Tracer | Enterprise Network

### 🌐 I’m excited to share that I have successfully completed a full enterprise network design and implementation project covering both Head Office and Branch Office environments. This project helped me gain solid hands-on experience with routing, switching, security, and wireless technologies.


## 	✅ Key Highlights of the Project
### 🔹 Subnetting & IP Addressing for multi-department networks
###🔹OSPF configuration on routers & multilayer switches for dynamic routing
###🔹 DHCP Server deployment for automated IP distribution
###🔹 VLAN configuration and segmentation for departments (Trainee, Marketing, Accounts, HR, Sales, Management, Servers, etc.)
###🔹 Inter-VLAN Routing with DHCP helper addresses
###🔹 GRE Site-to-Site VPN between Head Office and Branch for secure connectivity
###🔹 EtherChannel configuration for redundancy and load balancing
###🔹 PAT & ACL setup for secure internet and resource access
###🔹 Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) & Access Point configuration
###🔹 Security implementation on switches (Port security on F0/5 server switch)
###🔹 Testing & verification of end-to-end connectivity and access restrictions
